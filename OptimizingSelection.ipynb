    "In a certain organization, a recruitment is being conducted to admit new members. For every two members, a mentor from that organization must be assigned. Each mentor interviews the newly admitted member in advance on a speed dating basis. In this way, recruits with mentors rate each other on a scale of 0 to 3. It is necessary to assign such baby members to mentors that the sum of assigned scores is as high as possible. \n"

    "Imagine a weighted graph with edges of a given capacity, consisting of 3n+2 vertices, where n is the number of mentors. The first of these will represent the source and will be accessed by 2n units. From the source there will be n edges to n vertices, each with capacity 2 and cost 0. These vertices represent the given mentors. From each of vertices 1 - n there will be an edge to vertices n+1-3n, which represent baby members. Each such edge will have a throughput equal to 1 and a cost equal to the sum of the ratings that the members have given between each other. The last vertex will act as an outlet, to which edges with a throughput of 1 and a cost of 0 will lead from vertices denoting baby memebers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With such a graph we can perform an algorithm calculating min cost flow, whose implementation can be found in Python. In this way we will find the most optimal solution. "
